Factory Segment: Start of Factory - stock pile robot to shuttle popup

Compiling and running the main function:
	We wrote our code in eclipse, so if you open the project with eclipse, it will compile.
	Run RunStartOfFactory.java.
	
	If you don't have eclipse, to run the main function, you will need to compile everything in
	the MockAnimations, AgentBase, Interfaces, and Transducer packages before running
	RunStartOfFactory.java.
	
Unit Tests:
	The unit tests handle one piece of glass interacting with the agents.
	
Main:
	ONE PIECE (RunStartOfFactoryOnePiece):
	The main function in RunStartOfFactoryOnePiece.java gives one piece of glass to the stock pile robot.
This glass will run through the factory until it is passed off to a mocked shuttle
agent.  This movement through the factory is simulated by print statements.
	
	TWO PIECES (RunStartOfFactoryTwoPieces):
	The main function in RunStartOfFactoryTwoPieces.java gives two pieces of glass to the stock pile robot.
These two pieces of glass will run through the factory until they are passed off to a mocked shuttle
agent.  This movement through the factory is simulated by print statements.

	The main function has simulated calls from the GUI for the glass reaching the pre-popup sensor.
This is controlled by timers, so please allow a minute for the program to run so the timers will
complete.  The timers are long enough our computers to simulate the glass traveling on the conveyor;
however, if you notice the glass is reaching the prepopup sensor before it's on the conveyor, please
go into the RunStartOfFactory.java file and increase the delay time on the timertasks in lines 60 and 62.
